# Skin Cancer Detection using Dermoscopy Images

Melanoma is the most dangerous type of skin cancer, affecting 91,270 adults in 2016 with an increase of 
3% per year from 2004 to 2014. Detecting Melanoma is challenging, thus, Dermatoscopy is used to obtain 
high quality images which helps in detecting cancer in its early stages. Until now, it was the Dermatologists 
who were responsible to detect if the skin infection is cancerous or benign. This puts Dermatologists in high
demand and they need to do a lot of work even for cases which can be benign. Thus, we intend to provide a good
way to filter out the benign cases, which would make the work of Dermatologists much more efficient. Advances
in Deep Learning techniques and Image Processing make it possible to detect Melanoma with high accuracy. Our
proposed model will be able to detect whether a skin patch is malignant or benign from a given input image
using Deep learning techniques.
